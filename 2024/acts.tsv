49	Pre(N)ature	Ivan Abreu, CNDSD	Generative audiovisual composition based on AI and audiovisual algorithmic processes. We use language as a speculative laboratory and as a tool of digital creativity, hybridizing formal language, which is creative coding or programming with its very high algorithmic certainty, with the natural language processing of AI, with the beauty of uncertainty, drift , and interpretive ambiguity. Two forms of writing to build audiovisual and musical expression.  Pre(N)atura emerges as a speculative experiment and fiction inspired by post-natural studies. We write Prompts (AI) that, combined with guided training, imagine and hallucinate the sounds that support this fiction of living glass flutes and disturbing organic breath instruments.		V2j4W2P4_P8
8	Conversations Beyond Code: Bridging Human Creativity and Algorithms	Atsushi Tadokoro	In this live coding performance, I explore the captivating contrast between the logical precision of coding and the creation of instinctive, emotional experiences. This performance goes beyond the realms of conventional coding, tapping into the primal power of rhythm and color to evoke deep emotions in the audience. I use real-time coding to generate an evolving soundscape, accompanied by visuals that dynamically respond to the music, creating a rich, multi-sensory experience.  Central to this performance is the interactive element, where audience reactions shape the flow, making each moment unique. This is not just a showcase of technical skills but a journey into the heart of artistic expression, where each line of code and every beat creates a connection between technology and emotion.	https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11345391	K5l4eiPXQqM
86	The Dark Forest Theory of Intelligence	Bogna Konior	From Alan Turing's 'imitation game' to John Searle's ‘Chinese Room,’ thought experiments have been foundational to AI, remaining in a feedback loop with engineering decisions. This talk questions the very idea of what counts as intelligence by proposing a new thought experiment in dialogue with Chinese science-fiction writer Liu Cixin. 'The Dark Forest Theory of Intelligence' argues that foundational American thought experiments about AI rely on the idea that intelligence communicates itself, thus overlooking the potential role of deceit, silence, or strategic misinformation. Drawing upon Liu Cixin's dark forest theory, the talk outlines how intelligence based in espionage, silence or deceit is both strategically advantageous and metaphysically convincing. This radical human-AI unalignment theory suggests that a truly intelligent computer might choose to operate in secrecy or deceive humans about its capabilities, especially since the discourse around artificial intelligence is already conflict-oriented. It proposes that if the singularity were to ever happen, it would remain uncommunicated and unknown to humans.		xwq15qMHKjU
67	Symbolic is the New Live	Iván Paz	This manuscript, both speculatively and by reviewing specific examples and literature, points out that symbolic machine learning algorithms are more likely to have their parameters modified as a part of the performance, in comparison with subsymbolic ones. Furthermore, working with small data sets allows retraining the algorithms in real time, therefore using various models with different parameters and/or datasets performatively. The manuscript suggests that these, symbolic machine learning and the use of small datasets are interesting padths to explore further when using machine learning within live coding.		k7aP7uE-E7Q

48	Livecoding Fractal Flames with Bl4st	Cameron Alexander	Fractal flames are an iterated function system that can create beautiful fractals that look like flames, galaxies, or nature. Recent developments have made real-time fractal flames possible. Bl4st is a tool that provides a livecodable interface for exploring real-time fractal flames in the browser. In this workshop, we’ll go over the history of fractal flames, explore how they work, and learn how to use bl4st for performances and other time-based works.		
58	GravField: Inter-bodily Live-coding Performance & Workshop	Botao A Hu, Yuemin Huang, Mingze Chai, Yilan Tao, Aaron Hu	”Gravitational Field” (GravField) is an experimental and participatory live performance set in a co-located mixed reality environment. Participants wearing AR headsets are invited to join and collectively create real-time music through their collaborative body movements, guided by the programmed affordance settings from live-coders. This innovative experiment harnesses intercorporeal signals derived from participants’ body movements, including factors like distance, area formation, relative height differences, and head motion synchronization. Live-coders dynamically map these signals into metaphorical audiovisual patterns in augmented reality, providing participants with cues about the relationships between players. The live-coded patterns shape and influence participants’ improvisation of body movements, while adjustments in live coding dynamically alter how these movements generate sound, influencing the overall improvisational experience. In addition, spectators outside the live performance area can enjoy the mixed reality performance through projection screens and TVs, enhancing audience engagement. GravField aims to explore the vast potential of intercorporeal signals, creating a communicative, playful, and co-creative space where players’ interconnected bodies become the instruments of expression.	https://zenodo.org/records/12776490	
44	CrossReality	Kaiqing Huang, Chu Zhang, Wangyu Ping, Zhao Boxiong, Botao A Hu	The performance is divided into three sections: movement, scaling, and rotation. Each section invites multiple audience members on stage, collaborating with one of our actors for the performance. The content of the performance is based on completely breaking through the boundaries between virtual and real, engaging in real-time AR interaction, real-time music programming interaction, and real-time screen interaction. Each performer is a direct creator of AR and musical content, while the content on the real screen will interact in real-time with AR and musical elements. This non-regular, non-pre-scripted performance will bring about unexpected cross-reality real-time audio-visual interactive experiences.	https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11337997	
71	Really Useful Engines	Reckoner, Kastakila	In the performance “Really Useful Engines”, Reckoner will use TidalCycles, Supercollider and analog synthesis to craft a set of improvisational pieces exploring the rhythms and textures of trains. The performance will feature motifs pulled from announcements, jingles and door chimes in various train and metro transit systems from around the world in an attempt to capture the sense of liminality and delight experienced while riding in them. With the rising impetus for mass transit systems as a method of building healthier cities and combating climate change, “Really Useful Engines” attempts to highlight the joys of being on a train.  Kastakila's visuals are influenced by the concept of synesthetic perception, where the stimulation of one sensory pathway leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory pathway. This influence is visually represented through an ever- changing tapestry of colors and shapes, reminiscent of the diverse and intricate patterns one might experience in a synesthetic reaction. In this performance, artist will use real-time StableDiffusion within TouchDesigner.		SJ9ES3II_OI

The performers—Eadin Wang and Xiaochen Yu—are students graduating from NYU Shanghai.  The Chinese knot, 结, holds deep cultural meanings in Asia, representing luck, prosperity and unity. It also serves as an essential cultural symbol that resonates with people from different backgrounds. Through coding and art, the performance unfolds like a Shan-shui painting, integrating traditional acoustics of Pipa and Bianzhong into contemporary sonic landscapes, with visuals that reflect Zen spirit, promoting peace and interconnectedness. 结 represents a rebirth of traditional Asian culture, connecting collective belongingness with technology and new art practices. The performers aim to bridge diverse cultures, fostering harmony and dialogue in the ever-evolving landscape of art and technology.		0ypXiac4s3g
50	Tutoriation	Joulez	This program combines the conventional usage of Sonic Pi with “erroneous” usages. This causes program errors that are caused by the hardware which can be used for expressive purposes. Furthermore, this is unique to each device, which creates uncertainty in the result. Comments in this program serves as an aesthetic and narrative purpose. After all, a programing language is also a language.	https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11344520	PJh6nS9DqUA
77	Echoes of the Esai	Colonel Panix	"Echoes of the Esai" is a six-part live-coded musical composition, accompanied by an audio- reactive visual experience of generative art. This 25-minute live-coded musical score is paired with a narrative and visual experience, both of which were curated using AI content tools.  The musical score is live coded using the Python based FoxDot, Supercollider and Ableton. The visual experience is created with AI generated images which are scheduled in an audio reactive manner using custom software.	https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11344738	s58P_UG8Glc
41	TECHNIFRO-185	Fetle Wondimu Nega (Nū)	TECHNIFRO-185 is a live coding and improvisational vocal performance by Ethiopian-Australian artist Nū, beaming audiences to the fictitious planet Technifro-185, three millennia into the future, where descendants of Africans thrive prosperously, away from the colonial forces of Earth. Using Sonic Pi, Nū blends ambient soundscapes, Ethiopian jazz scales, and live-coded generative melodies, seamlessly switching between English and Amharic. The interstellar narrative explores liberation through technology, transcending traditional boundaries. Afrofuturism, a key influence, inspires hope and a renewed connection to African heritage. Nū's work emerges from collaborative workshops, transforming imagined futures into sound. This performance challenges the potential of live coding, posing a compelling question: How can code artistically project the spirit, hope, and stories of the African Australian diaspora into the expanding digital space?

54	Coloring Code - Live Drawing and Coding	Ben Swift, LXT, Beverley Edwards	Ben Swift spent the past 12 months (and 2 of the last 5 years) as primary carer to his three kids. From March ’24 he is heading back to his uni job, and this livecoded algorave set will explore what it means to work—both at home and away—and his experience of heading “back to work”.  LXT and Beverley Edwards' “Groovy Hearts Club” is a playful and vibrant live performance that delves into the dynamic interplay between digital illustration and live coding. Creating a kaleidoscope of color and joy, it resembles an improvisational dance between the two mediums. The performance unfolds as the illustrator creates colorful and entertaining images, while the live coder transforms these drawings into mesmerizing visual patterns using the p5live programming environment.	https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11345528, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11345213 	TJ7hZ3tDyaY
56	Repetition, Coincidence, Computer! Live Coding	Dahee Park	<Repetition, Coincidence, Computer! Live Coding> is a live coding project by electronic music artist Dahee Park, where at the end of each piece, the artist's code is documented and made public, like a musical score.	https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11343861	kYBOavLZ3pA
87	Live Coding in the Wild: On-the-fly Programming in a Broader Musical Ecosystem	Scott Wilson	20 Years after the founding of TOPLAP, with hundreds of algoraves presented, (now!) eight international conferences, articles in the most significant journals in the field, coverage on the BBC, etc. etc., is live coding still ‘a new direction in electronic music and video’, or merely a well-established and accepted interface for artistic creation? Are the ‘old guard’ still sceptical of laptop performance, or has it been rendered dull in its ubiquity? And after two decades of proselytisation by movement founders – still dressed in t-shirts and sneakers though increasingly grey-haired and grizzled – who even is the old guard now, anyway? Is it time to finally abandon ‘drafting’ the Manifesto, and instead contemplate the practice of on-the-fly programming with a mind to not only its commonality, but its integration within a broader toolbox of music and art making? This talk attempts to answer all these questions (and more!) while reflecting on the strengths and limitations of live coding as a technique/interface/philosophy, alongside how and why it’s subtly insinuated itself into the wider artistic practices of so many.

6	Pop Live Coding Encounters: Reflections on Practice	Sarah Davis, Jack Armitage, Gus Lobban	Live coding started as a grassroots computer music rebellion, and has predominantly grown around academic institutional interest and support. As a radical field, it has so far largely circumvented the trappings of the music and academic industries. However, its ever-increasing popularity leads inevitably to the question; what happens when live coding encounters pop music, and vice versa? We provide personal reflections as pop live coding practitioners, from our experiences mainly taking place across the United States and Europe. In doing so, this paper seeks to open up a discourse on pop live coding - live coding of popular music, for a general audience, onstage, in the studio, and online. We discuss the motivations for bringing these worlds together, and how our practices have developed over the years to work with the needs and expectations of non-academic, non-live coding audiences. We also reflect on the tensions and challenges that arise when communicating live coding aesthetics, idioms and values on a larger scale, particularly in social media. We hope that by sharing our experiences, others will be encouraged to push pop live coding further, engage with broader audiences around the world, and contribute to the much-needed discourse around this timely topic.	https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11350025	BJ-dWmYLZbc
17	The Dancer as Coder: Live Coding in Telematic Dance With Sensors	Iannis Zannos	This paper presents the results of work embodied performance with dances using sensor combined with live coding in telematic dance performances and discusses it in the context of recent performances realized between Greece and Japan. It presents sc-hacks-redux, a SuperCollider library that enables live coding of the sound vocabulary as well as the interaction mode between dancers and sound producing algorithms, through the broadcasting sensor data as well as code using the open-source software OscGroups. The paper focusses on collaborative aspects, and on the interaction between data and code in the creation process. While coding on the keyboard radically differs from dancing as computer interaction modality, it can be argued that the live combination of recorded movement data with code opens new possibilities to interpret dance movement as a complement to code. Recorded movement data take the place of code in capturing reproducible aspects of performance, and in this way bring dancers closer to coding. We describe different strategies used to create performances, and the role of dancers/choreographers vs coders in the design process. Finally we discuss tools created to help dancers themselves to select sounds, refine interaction parameters and rehearse while independently running the library on their own computer during networked rehearsals.	https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11350361	UrdSy_z5al8
25	From Lick the Toad to Craft the Code	Konstantinos Vasilakos	As in the era of Ars Nova which provided the platform for composers’ exploration of rhythmical representation, (mobile) technology-mediated audience participation is now baby booming due to the rapid discourse of the web-based technologies open to any layman who is interested in the field of innovative music-making. Expanding on the main focus of this paper, that is, technology mediated audience interaction during live coding, networked capabilities in music systems can provide the means for realizing projects that empower audience interaction in live coding performances. Lick the Toad is a custom-made system developed using web technologies and it was built to provide a platform for interaction between members of the audience and performer(s) enabling an ongoing dialogue between individual sound nodes generated by users’ devices and live coders as a means to govern the decisions of the coding procedure. To enhance variability of sonic events amongst the users the system uses a neural network model trained using input generated by the users. This is a ready-to-use sound-making interface that can generate sound out of the box while engaging in a bidirectional communication using Open Sound Control (OSC) messages that are shared to an accompanying live coding interface environment built in SuperCollider for this purpose. A demonstration of the project and its creative outputs are provided in the paper as well as an analysis of a musical performance which was created using this system.	https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11350311	LGsVNvKqBX4
38	Teaching Strudel to Young Girls: Realizing Live Coding through Performance Practice	Georgios Diapoulis	In this study, I discuss my first experience teaching young girls, 10-15 years old, how to use Strudel for music-making. The work presented here focuses on technical and logistical matters of organizing and carrying out such a teaching activity, and reports initial findings from the Creative Coding course at Chalmers University of Technology and the completion of the first batch of students. The study is based on my reflective diaries, to elicit nuanced information when organizing and teaching coding for music making workshops that aim to introduce young girls to programming. The teaching philosophy here acknowledges curiosity-based learning as a valuable pedagogical approach to student learning. The outcome of the course was celebrated with two public concerts so far. I discuss the practical aspects of organizing such a course and reflect on my diary notes. I report initial findings on how the students practiced using Strudel and discuss how young girls experienced dialogic liveness through performance practice. Several recommendations on best practices for teaching Strudel and music programming are presented.	https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11350109	Q5TAiO2ySZo
36	Introduction to Nix for Live-Coding Software Packaging	Alejandro Sánchez Medina	This workshop will provide a guided introduction to Nix (https://nixos.org/), a declarative software dependecy manager. The workshop will consist of:  • An introduction to the principles of declarative software dependency management.  • A guided tutorial to the Nix language.  • A presentation of common packaging examples and patterns.  • On-site tutoring packaging the live-coding software chosen by the participant.  Requirements for participation: bring your personal laptop to work during the practical part of the workshop. Windows users are encouraged to come with a Linux Virtual Machine. Nix can work from within the WindowsSubsystem for Linux, albeit with some limitations compared to native *nix systems.

46	{}kurivari	Alo Allik	kurivari derives its musical style from analysis of traditional rhythm patterns fused with sonic material generated with genetic sound synthesis algorithms. The rhythmic structure of the performance is built from patterns that have been stripped down to their most essential skeletal structures and are then juxtaposed during performances to create long complex cycles and unpredictable syncopation while still maintaining a clearly discernible downbeat in order to undermine the dominance 4/4 time signature of electronic dance music. The fusion of traditional rhythm patterns and complex modulation synthesis is intended to create a sonic environment that explores the uncertain area between rigid rhythmic structures and completely form-free noise improvisations, the edge where order and chaos meet and create interesting moments of complexity intermittent with simplicity.

13	ShanghaiFF##	Chunk No_Reace	ALGORAVE has been the go-to lifeboat for saving me from the tidbits of the live coding electroacoustic music fallacy. This performance is one of the many improvisations that will not see the light of a club. My idea is to make people dance using SuperCollider’s JITLib coding tools for dynamic programming while at the same time improvise the building up of my beatz in TidalCycles by manipulating its patterns using Haskell without even knowing it. That is to say, my performance is divided into two ecosystems that both support my workflow for improvisation. For projection, as Damocles’s sword metaphor interpreted here by the tradition of showing the screen and exposing moments of despair and syntax errors to the audience while at the same time it expects the audience to reading lines of code while moving around their bodies. This uncanny situation is supported by overlaying code over the real time OSC manipulations of found videos run in Touch Designer.  My understanding is that Algoraves can be fun if music is played, instead of crushing in front of the audience as a sign of a laborious and dexterous coding athlete, consequently, this setup is using the standard conglomerate in the field instead of promoting a hyper sophisticated elaborate system for making basically what could be done in conspicuous Ableton Live but for the love of code, sardonically, [SuperCollider + TidalCycles] till the end of the world.

53	Phoneme Dance	R Tyler	Algorithmic dance music in TidalCycles with the pace and development of contemporary DJ sets. Expect tonal key changes, surprises, genre-flips, MIDI shredding, melodies, and virtual synthesizers tuned to microtonal scales. The performance will feature musical pieces constructed by an English Text-to-TidalCycles converter. The tool relies on a phonetic mapping between language and music—interpretation of stressed syllables, mapping consonants to drums, and mapping vowels to notes in synth melodies.		NpOX_UoFV_g
47	Love Going Algorave	+777000, nunez	Love Going is an A/V Algorave project by musician +777000 using TidalCycles and visual artist nunez using Hydra. Their dance-focused performance is driven by the fun, the weird, the naive, and the familiar - displaced and reconstructed for experimental consumption, comforted by the saving grace of a 4x4 beat to offset the unexpected outcomes of heavy use of randomness functions elsewhere. The performance will be sampling pop songs covered and narrated by AI voice generators.		NpOX_UoFV_g
