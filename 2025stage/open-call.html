<!-- <p id="overview">The International Conference on Live Coding (ICLC) is dedicated to practices and research focused on technologies and philosophies that interpret the use of computer code as gesture within the context of live performances. In its previous editions the community has offered important insights on this practice from many diverse perspectives &ndash; technical, philosophical, educational, political and more.</p>
<p>ICLC 2023 takes place in Utrecht, The Netherlands from April 19 to April 23 2023, and we wish to challenge our community to bridge even further to its multidisciplinary strengths. We are pleased to invite submissions of proposed contributions in the form of theoretical works, live and live-recorded audio/visual performances, videos, workshops and satellite events. This call is open to everyone. We encourage submissions that cover <strong>any topic related to live coding</strong>, but in particular we invite the exploration of the following overarching main theme:</p> -->

<!-- <h2 class="mt-5 mb-5" id="themes">Displacement</h2>
<p>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement">Wikipedia</a>: <strong><em>Displacement (linguistics)</em></strong>, the ability of humans (and possibly some animals) to communicate ideas that are remote in time and/or space. <strong><em>Forced displacement</em></strong>, by persecution or violence. <strong><em>Displacement (psychology)</em></strong>, a sub-conscious defense mechanism.)</p>
<p>The last few years, and probably also the years that will follow, show us how easily physical spaces we once considered safe and secure can become increasingly hostile environments due to new strains of pathogens, climate change or aggression. At the same time, we are confronted with new technologies for automated creation that might drastically change the value of the digital artisan's craft.</p>
<p>We invite you to reflect on the roles and opportunities that live coding practices, techniques and communities can play in these times of displacement &ndash; but equally to be inspired by other uses of the term, e.g. rhythmic displacement in music, displacement shaders, displacement in terms of physics, linguistics or psychology or generally being out-of-place, in many places at the same time or in representation instead of in situ.</p>

<p class="mt-5">More concretely, we are particularily looking for submissions relating to any of the following topics:</p>

<h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">(Trans|Inter)disciplinary Live Coding</h3>
<p>Live Coding is represented by communities with a strong focus on making audio and music. The writing of code as a performative act is however also practiced in other maker cultures and disciplines such as graphic design, visuals, games (shaders/demoscene), education, theatre and dance. As such the practice of live coding is displaced to other disciplines making it more inter- and transdisciplinary in character. We encourage submissions reflecting on how approaches and ideologies to live coding differ or overlap between these cultures, as well as on how they influence other disciplines and foster interdisciplinary collaboration.</p>

<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Human/Machine Entanglement</h3>
<p>The live coding practice is now 20 years old, having grown up alongside the processes that transformed AI and machine learning research in the mid-90s. Today we are looking at the diverse algorithmic agencies of the learning systems used in live coding context. The live coding feedback loop entangles mind, body and machines within physical interactions, through both machine-body and machine-mind relationships. We encourage submissions reflecting on those intersections, embracing questions such as live vs. offline training, dataset bias and size, algorithmic agencies and human-machine entanglements. Moreover, we look for submissions analysing displacement or re-placement of creativity.</p>

<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Community Reports</h3>
<p>We believe that one of the strong pillars of live coding is the community, both digitally and locally. It is the effort of people working together that helps to shape the live coding practice, facilitate spaces, define its tendencies and aesthetics and influence its outreach. In past years we have seen the communities around live coding expand, diversify, and professionalize while building bonds with each other to make a global community. The conference will open a space for 'Community Reports' &ndash; a short presentation introducing your local community and activities. Share with us the characteristics that define your community, its history, your ways of organizing and working together, your difficulties and your successes.</p>

<h2 class="mb-4" id="who">Who we are</h2>
<p>The 2023 ICLC edition is organized by four live coding communities and artistic institutions based in the Netherlands, Ljubljana, Barcelona and Karlsruhe. This partnership emerged from the <a href="https://onthefly.space">on-the-fly</a> project carried out by a spread network across those places. Therefore, this ICLC edition is produced with a commitment to distributed work, where the organization process occurs as a feedback loop between communities.</p>

<p><strong>Organizing Institutions:</strong> <a href="https://creativecodingutrecht.nl/">Creative Coding Utrecht (CCU)</a>, <a href="https://www.toplap.cat/">TOPLAP Barcelona</a>, <a href="https://wiki.ljudmila.org/">LJUDMILA Art and Science Laboratory</a>, <a href="https://toplap-ka.de/">TOPLAP Karlsruhe</a>, <a href="https://netherlands-coding-live.github.io/">Netherlands Coding Live</a></p>

<p><strong>Organizing Committee:</strong> Fabian van Sluijs, Saskia Freeke, Felipe Ignacio Noriega, Rafaele Andrade, Raphael Sousa Santos, Iván Paz, Lina Bautista, Ludovica Michelin, Alicia Champlin, Niklas Reppel, Luka Frelih, Patrick Borgeat, Timo Hoogland, Roger Pibernat</p>

<p><strong>Location: Utrecht, The Netherlands</strong></p>
<p>Live coding performances during ICLC 2023 will take place at a diverse selection of venues both in and around Utrecht.</p>

<hr class="mt-5"/>
<h2 class="text-uppercase mb-4" id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>All participants are expected to read and adhere to the <a href="code-of-conduct.html">ICLC 2023 official Code of Conduct</a>, not only at the Conference but in all related proceedings and interactions with the ICLC community, online or in person.</p>

<h4 class="mt-4">Environmental Statement</h4>
<p>We invite everyone to reflect on the impact that our research and practice has on our environment and ecosystems. Acknowledging this, we are incorporating sustainability and conservation criteria as guidelines for the conference planning. We invite everyone to take this into consideration before and after the conference. In the spirit of coming together for a live event, we want to encourage in-person attendance, and also encourage that attendees joining us make choices to minimize the impact of their travel with low-carbon options whenever possible. We also commit to fostering connections among attendees and nearby satellite events, to make the most of long distance travel with opportunities to turn your visit into a mini-tour. The presentations and performances of the conference will be live-streamed whenever possible. We are also open to hosting remote presentations when this is the best option. </p> -->

	<li>Submit via email to <a href="mailt:iclc-events@creativecodingutrecht.nl">iclc-events@creativecodingutrecht.nl</a> until January 15, 2023</li></ul>
<p>We invite live coding nodes from all over the world &ndash; but in particular from Europe &ndash; to host their own satellite events prior or after ICLC 2023. The goal is to create opportunities for traveling artists to perform or do a workshop in multiple locations (or on the way from/to Utrecht) and to turn ICLC 2023 into a tour &ndash; with Utrecht at its peak. While the committee of the ICLC cannot directly help with funding or organisation of your event an effort will be made to coordinate dates, locations and potential artists.</p>

<p>Please submit your intent to participate with your own event, providing us with a principal contact to your group/organization, the city where the event will take place and any information that might already be definitive (set date, set venue, line-up...). Additionally we invite you to join the channel #iclc-satellite-events on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/D4Enr5u7Rp">TOPLAP Discord server</a> to present and discuss your ideas for a satellite event in order to connect organizers as early as possible to make the most out of it.
</p>
	
<p>We ask you to investigate possibilities to apply for local funding to help cover for accomodations, travel costs and in the best case artist fees. We can provide you with a Letter of Intent to support applications for funding, and will publish the date and url of your event on the ICLC website.</p>

<hr class="mt-5"/>
<h2 class="mb-4" id="fees-funding">Fees &amp; Funding Information</h2>

<p>There are no fees to submit a proposal for peer review.</p> 

<p>This year we want to make the conference accessible to as many people as possible. In doing so, we will propose a modest registration fee only for those with institutional support. The money collected from these fees will then be used to sponsor the travel of those who are not supported by a private or public institution. If you will be participating in the conference as a speaker or performer you can apply for travel asssistance.</p>

<p>Participants are also encouraged to seek outside funding. The committee can provide participants with Letters of Invitation/Intent to apply for support through local internationalization grants or the embassies that support cultural exchange.</p>

<p>Please follow ICLC 2023 updates for more details to come about registration fees and travel assistance.</p>

<h2 class="mb-4" id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

<ul>
	<li><a href="#faq-1">WILL THE SUBMISSION DEADLINE BE EXTENDED THIS YEAR?</a></li>
	<li><a href="#faq-2">Is the community report a paper OR a video, or can it also be a paper AND a video?</a></li>
	<li><a href="#faq-3">Does the paper or video for community reports have to be finished before the submission deadline or can it be finished later for the camera ready deadline?</a></li>
	<li><a href="#faq-4">Are Satellite events meant to take place at the same time as the conference and as a substitute for it, or adjacent events before and after the conference? </a></li>
</ul>

<h5 id="faq-1" class="mt-5">Will the submission deadline be extended this year?</h5>
<p>
	Because we want to publish the invitations as soon as possible, so that there is time to make sensible travel arrangements, we will not be extending the submission deadline beyond the original cutoff date of December 15th. However! We still want to give a little bit of wiggle room, so:
	<ul>
	<li>All submissions <strong>registered</strong> by the end of the 15th of December (before 00:00 GMT on 16th) can be <strong>edited</strong> until the end of the 18th of December so that final touches can be added or updated. This means you must create the entry and receive a Submission ID via email, so that you can log back in later and make your updates, until the 18th. <strong>The system will stop assigning Submission IDs at 00:00 GMT on Dec. 16th.</strong></li>
	<li>An additional reminder: proposals for <strong>long-form videos and community report videos</strong> only require a 5 minute teaser, so the full video can be finished until camera-ready deadlines.</li>
	<li>Another reminder: Because we intend that all community reports will be published in the proceedings, regardless of peer review, these submissions may be accepted late, but <strong>only community report papers received by the submission deadline will be peer reviewed for possible presentation at the Conference</strong>. Later submissions will only be in the proceedings. Later community report videos can still be included in the digital gallery.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h5 id="faq-2" class="mt-5">Is the community report a paper OR a video, or can it also be a paper AND a video?</h5>
<p>Any combination is allowed.</p>


<h5 id="faq-3" class="mt-5">Does the paper or video for community reports have to be finished before the submission deadline or can it be finished later for the camera ready deadline?</h5>
<p>Because we intend that all community reports will be published in the proceedings, regardless of peer review, these submissions may be accepted late, but <strong>only community report papers received by the submission deadline will be peer reviewed for possible presentation at the Conference</strong>. Later submissions will only be in the proceedings. Later community report videos can still be included in the digital gallery.</p>

<h5 id="faq-4" class="mt-5">Are Satellite events meant to take place at the same time as the conference and as a substitute for it, or adjacent events before and after the conference?</h5>
<p>We envision Satellite Events as a potential to both engage local communities where travel to Utrecht is highly impractical, and as a scheme to create additional dates around Europe that would foster a touring opportunity for artists who are coming a long way to ICLC, to get the most out of their travel. So, we encourage any kind of event, but if in Europe, we hope you'll choose dates that are well-coordinated with other Satellite Events to join in creating a sort of <strong>itinerary</strong> that is accessible to as many artists as possible, rather than coinciding with other events or the conference itself. Please check out <strong>#iclc-satellite-events</strong> on the <a href="https://t.co/67hP3XJkuU">TOPLAP Discord</a> to join the conversation.</p>

<h2 id="about"><strong>ABOUT</strong></h2>

      <p>
        The International Conference on Live Coding (ICLC) is dedicated to
        practices and research focused on technologies and philosophies that
        interpret the use of computer code and the public writing of algorithms
        as performative gestures. In its previous editions the community has
        provided valuable insights on this practice from diverse perspectives,
        including artistic, technical, artistic, philosophical, educational,
        social and political.
      </p>

      <p>
        It has been <strong>ten years</strong> since the first ICLC call for
        participation, which proposed
        <i
          >“[…] exploring liveness in symbolic abstractions, and understanding
          the perceptual, creative, productive, philosophical and cultural
          consequences.”</i
        >
        In the subsequent decade, we have collectively and collaboratively
        experimented with varying levels of live coding abstraction, developed
        domain-specific languages, and explored the levels of agency offered by
        models created manually, or sometimes with the assistance of learning
        algorithms. We have invented and played with numerous interfaces to
        interact with algorithms and the world around us during performances.
        These explorations revolve around defining what processes we actually
        want to showcase, and in which formats we want to express them, while
        “thinking algorithmically” with an audience.
      </p>

      <p>
        On this, the 9th edition of the conference, we invite the community to
        reflect about <strong><em>liveness</em></strong> and its many forms and
        consequences within live coding. We believe the tension between what is
        live and what is not is a key element of live coding. What effects does
        it have on the processes, technologies and forms in the performance? How
        do the many forms of liveness impact and transform the hybridization
        between the digital/algorithmic and the material? How does liveness
        relate to and/or define the socio-cultural aspects of live coding
        communities?
      </p>

      <h2 id="call-for-participation">
        <strong>CALL FOR PARTICIPATION</strong>
      </h2>

      <h4 id="iclc-satellite-events"><strong>ICLC Satellite Events</strong></h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Format: Declaration of interest</li>
        <li>
          Submit via email to
          <a href="mailto:iclc@toplap.cat">iclc@toplap.cat</a> until January 1st
          2025.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We invite live coding nodes from all over the world to host their own
        satellite events prior or after ICLC 2025. In particular we want to
        encourage other communities to create opportunities for traveling
        artists to perform or do a workshop in multiple locations (or on the way
        from/to Barcelona) and to turn ICLC 2025 into a tour – with Barcelona at
        its peak. While the committee of the ICLC cannot directly help with
        funding or organization of your event, an effort will be made to
        coordinate dates, locations and potential artists.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please submit your intent to participate with your own event, providing
        us with a principal contact to your group/organization, the city where
        the event will take place and any information that might already be
        definitive (set date, set venue, line-up…). Additionally we invite you
        to join the channel <b>#iclc-satellite-events</b> on the
        <a href="https://discord.com/invite/D4Enr5u7Rp"
          >TOPLAP Discord server</a
        >
        to present and discuss your ideas for a satellite event in order to
        connect organizers as early as possible to make the most out of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        We ask you to investigate possibilities to apply for local funding to
        help cover for accommodations, travel costs and in the best case artist
        fees. We can provide you with a <i>Letter of Intent</i> to support
        applications for funding, and will publish the date and URL of your
        event on the ICLC website.
      </p>

      
            
      <h1 id="environmental-statement">
        <strong>ENVIRONMENTAL STATEMENT</strong>
      </h1>

      <p>
        We invite everyone to reflect on the impact that our research and
        practice has on our environment and ecosystems. Acknowledging this, we
        are incorporating sustainability and conservation criteria as guidelines
        for the conference planning. We invite everyone to take this into
        consideration before and after the conference. In the spirit of coming
        together for a live event, we want to encourage in-person attendance,
        and also encourage that attendees joining us make choices to minimize
        the impact of their travel with low-carbon options whenever possible. We
        also commit to fostering connections among attendees and nearby
        satellite events, to make the most of long distance travel with
        opportunities to turn your visit into a mini-tour. The presentations and
        performances of the conference will be live-streamed whenever possible.
        We are also open to hosting remote presentations when this is the best
        option.
      </p>
