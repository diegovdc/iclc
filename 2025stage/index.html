paragraph('about', 'Theme: Displacement',
`(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement">Wikipedia</a>: <strong><em>Displacement (linguistics)</em></strong>, the ability of humans (and possibly some animals) to communicate ideas that are remote in time and/or space. <strong><em>Forced displacement</em></strong>, by persecution or violence. <strong><em>Displacement (psychology)</em></strong>, a sub-conscious defense mechanism.)</p>
<p>The last few years, and probably also the years that will follow, show us how easily physical spaces we once considered safe and secure can become increasingly hostile environments due to new strains of pathogens, climate change or aggression. At the same time, we are confronted with new technologies for automated creation that might drastically change the value of the digital artisan's craft.</p>
<p>We invite you to reflect on the roles and opportunities that live coding practices, techniques and communities can play in these times of displacement &ndash; but equally to be inspired by other uses of the term, e.g. rhythmic displacement in music, displacement shaders, displacement in terms of physics, linguistics or psychology or generally being out-of-place, in many places at the same time or in representation instead of in situ.</p>
<p class="mt-5">More concretely, we are particularily looking for submissions relating to any of the following topics:`

'(Trans|Inter)disciplinary Live Coding', 
`Live Coding is represented by communities with a strong focus on making audio and music. The writing of code as a performative act is however also practiced in other maker cultures and disciplines such as graphic design, visuals, games (shaders/demoscene), education, theatre and dance. As such the practice of live coding is displaced to other disciplines making it more inter- and transdisciplinary in character. We encourage submissions reflecting on how approaches and ideologies to live coding differ or overlap between these cultures, as well as on how they influence other disciplines and foster interdisciplinary collaboration.

paragraphImageRight('p1',
'Human/Machine Entanglement',
`The live coding practice is now 20 years old, having grown up alongside the processes that transformed AI and machine learning research in the mid-90s. Today we are looking at the diverse algorithmic agencies of the learning systems used in live coding context. The live coding feedback loop entangles mind, body and machines within physical interactions, through both machine-body and machine-mind relationships. We encourage submissions reflecting on those intersections, embracing questions such as live vs. offline training, dataset bias and size, algorithmic agencies and human-machine entanglements. Moreover, we look for submissions analysing displacement or re-placement of creativity.

paragraphImageLeft('p1',
'Community Reports',
`We believe that one of the strong pillars of live coding is the community, both digitally and locally. It is the effort of people working together that helps to shape the live coding practice, facilitate spaces, define its tendencies and aesthetics and influence its outreach. In past years we have seen the communities around live coding expand, diversify, and professionalize while building bonds with each other to make a global community. The conference will open a space for 'Community Reports' &ndash; a short presentation introducing your local community and activities. Share with us the characteristics that define your community, its history, your ways of organizing and working together, your difficulties and your successes.
